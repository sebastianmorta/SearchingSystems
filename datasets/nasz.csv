When Roman Cervenka came over to the NHL in 2013 Calgary fans were elated.Cervenka led the KHL in scoring with 31 goals in 2010-11 and then had the most playoff points the year after. Add in an Olympic appearance and a World Championship gold with Czechia and Cervenka did everything he possibly could while playing overseas.Unfortunately he never did look too comfortable in Calgary. Entering the league at 26 years old Cervenka had just nine goals and 17 points in the lockout-shortened 2012-13 season and was back to the KHL the following year. He never could find his old form again in Russia and has spent the past six seasons in Switzerland.Prior to the Beijing Olympics Cervenka had been hands off with the national team since the 2018 World Championship when he recorded just two assists. Cervenka then laid a beating on the top Swiss league for four seasons before returning for the Olympics in February leading the team with five points in four games.So Cervenka someone Czechia was counting on in this tournament and he delivered. Cervenka finished first in scoring with 17 points in 10 games en route to bronze and the tournament's top forward honor. Cervenka himself as the perfect complement to the formidable top-line duo of David Pastrnak and David Krejci that ultimately proved too dangerous for the United States in the third-place game.;rec.sport.hockey
"More Americans died of gun-related injuries in 2020 than in any other year on record according to recently published statistics from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). That included a record number of gun murders as well as a near-record number of gun suicides. Despite the increase in such fatalities the rate of gun deaths – a statistic that accounts for the nation’s growing population – remains below the levels of earlier years.Here’s a closer look at gun deaths in the United States based on a Pew Research Center analysis of data from the CDC the FBI and other sources. You can also read key public opinion findings about U.S. gun violence and gun policy in our recent roundup.How we did thisHow many people die from gun-related injuries in the U.S. each year?A pie chart showing that suicides accounted for more than half of U.S. gun deaths in 2020In 2020 the most recent year for which complete data is available 45222 people died from gun-related injuries in the U.S. according to the CDC. That figure includes gun murders and gun suicides along with three other less common types of gun-related deaths tracked by the CDC: those that were unintentional those that involved law enforcement and those whose circumstances could not be determined. The total excludes deaths in which gunshot injuries played a contributing but not principal role. (CDC fatality statistics are based on information contained in official death certificates which identify a single cause of death.)What share of U.S. gun deaths are murders and what share are suicides?Though they tend to get less public attention than gun-related murders suicides have long accounted for the majority of U.S. gun deaths. In 2020 54% of all gun-related deaths in the U.S. were suicides (24292) while 43% were murders (19384) according to the CDC. The remaining gun deaths that year were unintentional (535) involved law enforcement (611) or had undetermined circumstances (400).What share of all murders and suicides in the U.S. involve a gun?Nearly eight-in-ten (79%) U.S. murders in 2020 – 19384 out of 24576 – involved a firearm. That marked the highest percentage since at least 1968 the earliest year for which the CDC has online records. A little over half (53%) of all suicides in 2020 – 24292 out of 45979 – involved a gun a percentage that has generally remained stable in recent years.How has the number of U.S. gun deaths changed over time?The 45222 total gun deaths in 2020 were by far the most on record representing a 14% increase from the year before a 25% increase from five years earlier and a 43% increase from a decade prior.Gun murders in particular have climbed sharply in recent years. The 19384 gun murders that took place in 2020 were the most since at least 1968 exceeding the previous peak of 18253 recorded by the CDC in 1993. The 2020 total represented a 34% increase from the year before a 49% increase over five years and a 75% increase over 10 years.The number of gun suicides has also risen in recent years – climbing 10% over five years and 25% over 10 years – and is near its highest point on record. The 24292 gun suicides that took place in 2020 were the most in any year except 2018 when there were 24432.How has the rate of U.S. gun deaths changed over time?While 2020 saw the highest total number of gun deaths in the U.S. this statistic does not take into account the nation’s growing population. On a per capita basis there were 13.6 gun deaths per 100000 people in 2020 – the highest rate since the mid-1990s but still well below the peak of 16.3 gun deaths per 100000 people in 1974.A line graph showing that U.S. gun suicide and gun murder rates have increased in recent years but remain below past highsThe gun murder and gun suicide rates in the U.S. both remain below their peak levels. There were 6.2 gun murders per 100000 people in 2020 below the rate of 7.2 recorded in 1974. And there were 7.0 gun suicides per 100000 people in 2020 below the rate of 7.7 measured in 1977. (One caveat when considering the 1970s figures: In the CDC’s database gun murders and gun suicides between 1968 and 1978 are classified as those caused by firearms and explosives. In subsequent years they are classified as deaths involving firearms only.)Which states have the highest and lowest gun death rates in the U.S.?A map showing that U.S. gun death rates varied widely by state in 2020The rate of gun fatalities varies widely from state to state. In 2020 the states with the highest rates of gun-related deaths – counting murders suicides and all other categories tracked by the CDC – included Mississippi (28.6 per 100000 people) Louisiana (26.3) Wyoming (25.9) Missouri (23.9) and Alabama (23.6). The states with the lowest rates included New York (5.3) Rhode Island (5.1) New Jersey (5.0) Massachusetts (3.7) and Hawaii (3.4).How does the gun death rate in the U.S. compare with other countries?The gun death rate in the U.S. is much higher than in most other nations particularly developed nations. But it is still far below the rates in several Latin American countries according to a 2018 study of 195 countries and territories by researchers at the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington.The U.S. gun death rate was 10.6 per 100000 people in 2016 the most recent year in the study which used a somewhat different methodology from the CDC. That was far higher than in countries such as Canada (2.1 per 100000) and Australia (1.0) as well as European nations such as France (2.7) Germany (0.9) and Spain (0.6). But the rate in the U.S. was much lower than in El Salvador (39.2 per 100000 people) Venezuela (38.7) Guatemala (32.3) Colombia (25.9) and Honduras (22.5) the study found. Overall the U.S. ranked 20th in its gun fatality rate that year.How many people are killed in mass shootings in the U.S. every year?This is a difficult question to answer because there is no single agreed-upon definition of the term “mass shooting.” Definitions can vary depending on factors including the number of victims and the circumstances of the shooting.The FBI collects data on “active shooter incidents” which it defines as “one or more individuals actively engaged in killing or attempting to kill people in a populated area.” Using the FBI’s definition 38 people – excluding the shooters – died in such incidents in 2020.The Gun Violence Archive an online database of gun violence incidents in the U.S. defines mass shootings as incidents in which four or more people are shot even if no one was killed (again excluding the shooters). Using this definition 513 people died in these incidents in 2020.Regardless of the definition being used fatalities in mass shooting incidents in the U.S. account for a small fraction of all gun murders that occur nationwide each year.How has the number of mass shootings in the U.S. changed over time?A chart showing that active shooter incidents have become more common in the U.S. in recent yearsThe same definitional issue that makes it challenging to arrive at an exact number of mass shooting fatalities comes into play when trying to determine the frequency of U.S. mass shootings over time. The unpredictability of these incidents also complicates matters: As Rand Corp. noted in a research brief “Chance variability in the annual number of mass shooting incidents makes it challenging to discern a clear trend and trend estimates will be sensitive to outliers and to the time frame chosen for analysis.”The FBI found an increase in active shooter incidents between 2000 and 2020. There were three such incidents in 2000; by 2020 that figure had increased to 40.Which types of firearms are most commonly used in gun murders in the U.S.?In 2020 handguns were involved in 59% of the 13620 U.S. gun murders and non-negligent manslaughters for which data is available according to the FBI. Rifles – the category that includes guns sometimes referred to as “assault weapons” – were involved in 3% of firearm murders. Shotguns were involved in 1%. The remainder of gun homicides and non-negligent manslaughters (36%) involved other kinds of firearms or those classified as “type not stated.”It’s important to note that the FBI’s statistics do not capture the details on all gun murders in the U.S. each year. The FBI’s data is based on information voluntarily submitted by police departments around the country and not all agencies participate or provide complete information each year.";talk.politics.guns
NEW YORK -- What a difference a year makes. Entering June 1 Mets shortstop Francisco Lindor has 42 RBIs which is second on the club behind Pete Alonso. A year ago at the same time Lindor had a mere 11 RBIs.Lindor said Tuesday morning he knows why he has been driving in runs in bunches this year. He said his approach at the plate has been consistent. Lindor also credits the team including manager Buck Showalter and hitting coaches Eric Chavez and Jeremy Barnes. It helps that Lindor and the rest of the Mets are not worried about launch angles. It’s about putting the ball in play.“Nobody is talking about lifting the baseball. No one” Lindor said. “Everybody is focusing on their approach and how to hit that pitcher and that’s it. Then after that [what] we witnessed in the box we passed it on to my teammates. You see the guys always talking. We always talk about hitting the pitcher and hitting. That helps a lot.”The biggest thing Lindor learned from Showalter is attention to details and doing things the right way on the baseball field.“He has been amazing. [Former manager] Luis Rojas is a good person and manager” Lindor said. “Buck Showalter has 20 years [or more] of experience in baseball. You pick things that [Showalter] has said throughout the year. He is passing it on to me. I love that. I continue to learn and get better. I respect him a lot. He is an amazing role model for a lot of us.”Lindor can’t say enough about Chavez and Barnes and for good reason. On Tuesday Lindor extended his RBI streak to a career-high nine games tied for third longest in Mets history. He drove in two runs during the fifth inning against the Nationals when he singled off Erasmo Ramírez to knock in Tomas Nido and Mark Canha.Francisco Lindor's two-run singleJun 1 2022 · 0:29Francisco Lindor's two-run single“Last year I had one good game and then five bad ones. Two good games then a week of bad games” Lindor said. “The hitting coaches [Chavez and Barnes] -- I rely on them [a lot]. Last year the hitting coaches were really good but the relationship wasn’t there. It was growing.“Now the relationship is there. It grew already. I trust them. Last year I trusted the guys [but at] the end of the year. You could see the results at the end of the year. They had to get to know me and understand my swing. With Eric and Jeremy from Day 1 we put in the time to get to know each other. Everybody is playing really good ball. It makes it easier for me.”;rec.sport.baseball
