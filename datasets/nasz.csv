When Roman Cervenka came over to the NHL in 2013 Calgary fans were elated.Cervenka led the KHL in scoring with 31 goals in 2010-11 and then had the most playoff points the year after. Add in an Olympic appearance and a World Championship gold with Czechia and Cervenka did everything he possibly could while playing overseas.Unfortunately he never did look too comfortable in Calgary. Entering the league at 26 years old Cervenka had just nine goals and 17 points in the lockout-shortened 2012-13 season and was back to the KHL the following year. He never could find his old form again in Russia and has spent the past six seasons in Switzerland.Prior to the Beijing Olympics Cervenka had been hands off with the national team since the 2018 World Championship when he recorded just two assists. Cervenka then laid a beating on the top Swiss league for four seasons before returning for the Olympics in February leading the team with five points in four games.So Cervenka someone Czechia was counting on in this tournament and he delivered. Cervenka finished first in scoring with 17 points in 10 games en route to bronze and the tournament's top forward honor. Cervenka himself as the perfect complement to the formidable top-line duo of David Pastrnak and David Krejci that ultimately proved too dangerous for the United States in the third-place game.;rec.sport.hockey
"More Americans died of gun-related injuries in 2020 than in any other year on record according to recently published statistics from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). That included a record number of gun murders as well as a near-record number of gun suicides. Despite the increase in such fatalities the rate of gun deaths – a statistic that accounts for the nation’s growing population – remains below the levels of earlier years.Here’s a closer look at gun deaths in the United States based on a Pew Research Center analysis of data from the CDC the FBI and other sources. You can also read key public opinion findings about U.S. gun violence and gun policy in our recent roundup.How we did thisHow many people die from gun-related injuries in the U.S. each year?A pie chart showing that suicides accounted for more than half of U.S. gun deaths in 2020In 2020 the most recent year for which complete data is available 45222 people died from gun-related injuries in the U.S. according to the CDC. That figure includes gun murders and gun suicides along with three other less common types of gun-related deaths tracked by the CDC: those that were unintentional those that involved law enforcement and those whose circumstances could not be determined. The total excludes deaths in which gunshot injuries played a contributing but not principal role. (CDC fatality statistics are based on information contained in official death certificates which identify a single cause of death.)What share of U.S. gun deaths are murders and what share are suicides?Though they tend to get less public attention than gun-related murders suicides have long accounted for the majority of U.S. gun deaths. In 2020 54% of all gun-related deaths in the U.S. were suicides (24292) while 43% were murders (19384) according to the CDC. The remaining gun deaths that year were unintentional (535) involved law enforcement (611) or had undetermined circumstances (400).What share of all murders and suicides in the U.S. involve a gun?Nearly eight-in-ten (79%) U.S. murders in 2020 – 19384 out of 24576 – involved a firearm. That marked the highest percentage since at least 1968 the earliest year for which the CDC has online records. A little over half (53%) of all suicides in 2020 – 24292 out of 45979 – involved a gun a percentage that has generally remained stable in recent years.How has the number of U.S. gun deaths changed over time?The 45222 total gun deaths in 2020 were by far the most on record representing a 14% increase from the year before a 25% increase from five years earlier and a 43% increase from a decade prior.Gun murders in particular have climbed sharply in recent years. The 19384 gun murders that took place in 2020 were the most since at least 1968 exceeding the previous peak of 18253 recorded by the CDC in 1993. The 2020 total represented a 34% increase from the year before a 49% increase over five years and a 75% increase over 10 years.The number of gun suicides has also risen in recent years – climbing 10% over five years and 25% over 10 years – and is near its highest point on record. The 24292 gun suicides that took place in 2020 were the most in any year except 2018 when there were 24432.How has the rate of U.S. gun deaths changed over time?While 2020 saw the highest total number of gun deaths in the U.S. this statistic does not take into account the nation’s growing population. On a per capita basis there were 13.6 gun deaths per 100000 people in 2020 – the highest rate since the mid-1990s but still well below the peak of 16.3 gun deaths per 100000 people in 1974.A line graph showing that U.S. gun suicide and gun murder rates have increased in recent years but remain below past highsThe gun murder and gun suicide rates in the U.S. both remain below their peak levels. There were 6.2 gun murders per 100000 people in 2020 below the rate of 7.2 recorded in 1974. And there were 7.0 gun suicides per 100000 people in 2020 below the rate of 7.7 measured in 1977. (One caveat when considering the 1970s figures: In the CDC’s database gun murders and gun suicides between 1968 and 1978 are classified as those caused by firearms and explosives. In subsequent years they are classified as deaths involving firearms only.)Which states have the highest and lowest gun death rates in the U.S.?A map showing that U.S. gun death rates varied widely by state in 2020The rate of gun fatalities varies widely from state to state. In 2020 the states with the highest rates of gun-related deaths – counting murders suicides and all other categories tracked by the CDC – included Mississippi (28.6 per 100000 people) Louisiana (26.3) Wyoming (25.9) Missouri (23.9) and Alabama (23.6). The states with the lowest rates included New York (5.3) Rhode Island (5.1) New Jersey (5.0) Massachusetts (3.7) and Hawaii (3.4).How does the gun death rate in the U.S. compare with other countries?The gun death rate in the U.S. is much higher than in most other nations particularly developed nations. But it is still far below the rates in several Latin American countries according to a 2018 study of 195 countries and territories by researchers at the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington.The U.S. gun death rate was 10.6 per 100000 people in 2016 the most recent year in the study which used a somewhat different methodology from the CDC. That was far higher than in countries such as Canada (2.1 per 100000) and Australia (1.0) as well as European nations such as France (2.7) Germany (0.9) and Spain (0.6). But the rate in the U.S. was much lower than in El Salvador (39.2 per 100000 people) Venezuela (38.7) Guatemala (32.3) Colombia (25.9) and Honduras (22.5) the study found. Overall the U.S. ranked 20th in its gun fatality rate that year.How many people are killed in mass shootings in the U.S. every year?This is a difficult question to answer because there is no single agreed-upon definition of the term “mass shooting.” Definitions can vary depending on factors including the number of victims and the circumstances of the shooting.The FBI collects data on “active shooter incidents” which it defines as “one or more individuals actively engaged in killing or attempting to kill people in a populated area.” Using the FBI’s definition 38 people – excluding the shooters – died in such incidents in 2020.The Gun Violence Archive an online database of gun violence incidents in the U.S. defines mass shootings as incidents in which four or more people are shot even if no one was killed (again excluding the shooters). Using this definition 513 people died in these incidents in 2020.Regardless of the definition being used fatalities in mass shooting incidents in the U.S. account for a small fraction of all gun murders that occur nationwide each year.How has the number of mass shootings in the U.S. changed over time?A chart showing that active shooter incidents have become more common in the U.S. in recent yearsThe same definitional issue that makes it challenging to arrive at an exact number of mass shooting fatalities comes into play when trying to determine the frequency of U.S. mass shootings over time. The unpredictability of these incidents also complicates matters: As Rand Corp. noted in a research brief “Chance variability in the annual number of mass shooting incidents makes it challenging to discern a clear trend and trend estimates will be sensitive to outliers and to the time frame chosen for analysis.”The FBI found an increase in active shooter incidents between 2000 and 2020. There were three such incidents in 2000; by 2020 that figure had increased to 40.Which types of firearms are most commonly used in gun murders in the U.S.?In 2020 handguns were involved in 59% of the 13620 U.S. gun murders and non-negligent manslaughters for which data is available according to the FBI. Rifles – the category that includes guns sometimes referred to as “assault weapons” – were involved in 3% of firearm murders. Shotguns were involved in 1%. The remainder of gun homicides and non-negligent manslaughters (36%) involved other kinds of firearms or those classified as “type not stated.”It’s important to note that the FBI’s statistics do not capture the details on all gun murders in the U.S. each year. The FBI’s data is based on information voluntarily submitted by police departments around the country and not all agencies participate or provide complete information each year.";talk.politics.guns
NEW YORK -- What a difference a year makes. Entering June 1 Mets shortstop Francisco Lindor has 42 RBIs which is second on the club behind Pete Alonso. A year ago at the same time Lindor had a mere 11 RBIs.Lindor said Tuesday morning he knows why he has been driving in runs in bunches this year. He said his approach at the plate has been consistent. Lindor also credits the team including manager Buck Showalter and hitting coaches Eric Chavez and Jeremy Barnes. It helps that Lindor and the rest of the Mets are not worried about launch angles. It’s about putting the ball in play.“Nobody is talking about lifting the baseball. No one” Lindor said. “Everybody is focusing on their approach and how to hit that pitcher and that’s it. Then after that [what] we witnessed in the box we passed it on to my teammates. You see the guys always talking. We always talk about hitting the pitcher and hitting. That helps a lot.”The biggest thing Lindor learned from Showalter is attention to details and doing things the right way on the baseball field.“He has been amazing. [Former manager] Luis Rojas is a good person and manager” Lindor said. “Buck Showalter has 20 years [or more] of experience in baseball. You pick things that [Showalter] has said throughout the year. He is passing it on to me. I love that. I continue to learn and get better. I respect him a lot. He is an amazing role model for a lot of us.”Lindor can’t say enough about Chavez and Barnes and for good reason. On Tuesday Lindor extended his RBI streak to a career-high nine games tied for third longest in Mets history. He drove in two runs during the fifth inning against the Nationals when he singled off Erasmo Ramírez to knock in Tomas Nido and Mark Canha.Francisco Lindor's two-run singleJun 1 2022 · 0:29Francisco Lindor's two-run single“Last year I had one good game and then five bad ones. Two good games then a week of bad games” Lindor said. “The hitting coaches [Chavez and Barnes] -- I rely on them [a lot]. Last year the hitting coaches were really good but the relationship wasn’t there. It was growing.“Now the relationship is there. It grew already. I trust them. Last year I trusted the guys [but at] the end of the year. You could see the results at the end of the year. They had to get to know me and understand my swing. With Eric and Jeremy from Day 1 we put in the time to get to know each other. Everybody is playing really good ball. It makes it easier for me.”;rec.sport.baseball
If you were around when the IBM PC rolled out, two things probably caught you by surprise. One is that the company that made the Selectric put that ridiculous keyboard on it. The other was that it had an 8-bit CPU onboard.  It was actually even stranger than that. The PC sported an 8088 which was a 16-bit 8086 stripped down to an 8 bit external bus. You have to wonder what caused that, and [Steven Leibson] has a great post that explains what went down all those years ago.Before the IBM PC, nearly all personal computers were 8-bit and had 16-bit address buses. Although 64K may have seemed enough for anyone, many realized that was going to be a brick wall fairly soon. So the answer was larger address buses and addressing modes.Intel knew this and was working on the flagship iAPX 432. This was going to represent a radical departure from the 8080-series CPUs designed from the start for high-level languages like Ada. However, the radical design took longer than expected. The project started in 1976 but wouldn’t see the light of day until 1981. It was clear they needed something sooner, so the 8086 — a 16-bit processor clearly derived from the 8080 was born.There were other choices, too. The Motorola 68000 was a great design, but it was expensive and not widely available when IBM was selecting a processor. TI had the TMS9900 in production, but they had bet on CPU throughput being the key to success and stuck with the same old 16-bit address bus. That processor, too, had a novel way of storing registers in main memory which was great if your CPU was slow, but as CPU speeds outpaced memory speeds, that was a losing design decision.That still leaves the question: why the 8088 instead of the 8086? Price. IBM had a goal to pay under $5 for a CPU and Intel couldn’t meet that price with the 8086. Apparently, it wasn’t a technical problem but a contractual one. However, folding the chip to an 8-bit external bus allowed for a smaller die, lower cost, and freedom from contractual obligations that plagued the 8086. That last point was important, as the manufacturing cost wasn’t that different, but setting the price was all about paperwork.There is a lot more to read. At the bottom of the post, you’ll find links to the source oral history transcripts from the Computer History Museum. Fascinating stuff. If you lived though it, you probably didn’t know all these details and if you didn’t, it gives a good flavor of how many choices there were in those days and how many design trades you had to make to get a product into the marketplace.We borrowed the title graphic from [Steven’s] post and he, in turn, borrowed it from the well-known [Ken Shirriff].;comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware
Intel and CEA-Leti have optimised a hybrid direct-bonding, self-assembly process for D2W (Die-to-Wafer) bonding that has the potential to increase the alignment accuracy as well as fabrication throughput by several thousand dies per hour.The approach uses capillary forces of a water droplet to align dies on a target wafer. While  the D2W hybrid bonding process is seen as being essential for the success of future memory, HPC and photonic devices, it is much more complex than wafer-to-wafer bonding, with lower alignment accuracy and lower die-assembly throughput.CEA-Leti has been developing a self-assembly method for several years, with the goal of substantially increasing throughput and placement accuracy.“Commercial scale throughput with D2W self-assembly presents two main challenges related to die handling,” says CEA-Leti’s  Emilie Bourjot, “if the self-assembly process is combined with a pick-and-place tool, the throughput can be increased by reducing the time of alignment, since the fine alignment is performed by the droplet. When self-assembly is combined with a collective die-handing solution, the throughput is increased by the fact that all dies are bonded together at the same time without any high precision placement at any time along the process flow.”Process optimization is also an important part of this work for increasing process maturity and targeting industrial requirements. “With such alignment and throughput performances, it is definitely a promising step allying the magic of physics and a simple drop of water,” says  Bourjot..The research paper noted that “capillary forces arise from the principle of surface minimization and are exerted through surface tension in the case of a liquid. From a macroscopic point of view, the liquid tends to minimize its liquid/air interface to reach an equilibrium state with minimized energy. This mechanism allows the self-alignment of the die on its bonding site.The liquid chosen as the realignment vector must present a high surface tension and has to be compatible with direct bonding. Most of the liquids have a surface tension between 20 and 50 mN/m, except water that exhibits a surface tension of 72.1 mN/m, which makes it an excellent candidate for self-assembly process using hydrophilic bonding in which water is already a key mechanism parameter.”“The water dispense technique and the surface preparation to tune the surface hydrophilicity appeared as critical for the proper conduct of the self-assembly process,” according to the paper. “Thus, excellent alignment performance on a homemade collective self-assembly bonding bench was achieved. It resulted in a mean misalignment inferior to 150 nm with a 3σ inferior to 500 nm. Finally, the compatibility of the self-assembly process with a wide range of die dimensions (8×8 mm², 2.7×2.7 mm2, 1.3×11.8 mm2 and 2.2×11.8 mm2) was demonstrated.”By comparison, state of the art alignment is 1µm with a pick-and-place tool post bonding, and the best case is 700nm, while a self-alignment process offers an alignment below 500nm and even less than 200nm, post bonding.Explaining the “homemade collective self-assembly bonding bench”, CEA-Leti said: “As no industrial tools for the self-assembly approach exist, the team fabricated its own lab bench enabling a collective self-assembly. The low-reproducibility, manual process control none-the-less achieved alignment of 500nm and below, which strongly suggests that an industrial tool dedicated to this process would deliver higher reproducibility, robustness and precision.”The paper’s conclusion emphasized this point: Despite these breakthroughs, “many aspects of the self-assembly still need to be explored and great improvements will only be possible when tool suppliers will develop (an) adapted tool to automate this process.”For this collaboration CEA-Leti designed the process flow, and performed wafer processing and self-assembly bondings with its expertise in bonding physics, processes and process integration. It also performed characterizations like nano-topography, scanning acoustic microscopy and alignment. Intel’s participation included providing specifications, modeling and pre-and-post bonding process integration expertise to make the self-assembly process foundry compatible.;sci.electronics
Unlike many conceptual flagship designs, Polestar has actually committed to building the stunning Precept electric sedan design study it showed off in 2020. Polestar promises the final version will retain much of the striking detail of the concept car and be called the Polestar 5. New illustrations published to the European Union Intellectual Property Office website this week reveal that should be the case indeed, as the 5's patent images show a design that's nearly identical to the concept's look, albeit with more normal-sized wheels.Polestar 5 patent 1filterSEE ALL 21 PHOTOSThe patent filing for a new vehicle was published at the end of last month, and reported on this week by Car and Driver. The filing links seven new images of what appear to be the production-ready Polestar 5, filed by Polestar Performance AB. There's not much else detailed in the description of the patent filing, but the placement of the door handles suggests the rear suicide doors have been swapped for a traditional setup, and some chunkier, more production-feasible trim gives this away as a salable version of the concept.Polestar Precept Front Three QuarterfilterSEE ALL 21 PHOTOSPolestar also hasn't been too tight lipped about what we can expect so far. The production 5 will ride on an all-new, designed-in-house bonded aluminum spaceframe platform, but it will share its 800-volt electrical architecture with the Polestar 3, which will introduce that feature to the Polestar lineup for the first time. Gone is a traditional rear window, with the 5 using camera systems for rear-view functionality instead. The large rear hatch will carry over to production, as will the glass roof and adaptive headlights.The 5 is due to be Polestar's flagship model as the brand attempts to distinguish itself even further from its Volvo and Geely parentage. The automaker has previously said the 5 sedan will come after the 3 and 4 crossover models have been introduced, and will go on sale in 2024. We expect to see it in production form far before that, though, likely by the end of this year.;rec.autos
"One of Boris Johnson's strongest cabinet allies has hit out out Tory MPs trying to oust him, accusing them of doing ""the opposition's work"".Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries claimed growing calls for the PM to resign were the result of a ""co-ordinated campaign"" by backbenchers.Criticism of Mr Johnson among Tory MPs has increased since Sue Gray's Partygate report last week.But Ms Dorries said the ""overwhelming"" majority still backed him.Twelve Conservative MPs have called on Mr Johnson to quit since the release of Ms Gray's report laid bare the scale of Covid rule-breaking in No 10.It takes the number now openly calling on him to resign to 28. Most of have written letters of no confidence in him, although the total number formally calling for a contest may be higher.Mr Johnson has dismissed calls for him to quit, adding it would not be ""responsible right now given everything that's going on"".Who are the Tory MPs calling on Johnson to go?How could Boris Johnson be voted out by Tory MPs?Explain why partygate did not breach code, PM toldUnder Tory party rules, 54 letters are required to set up a vote on the PM's position, a move which could eventually lead to a contest to replace him.Only Sir Graham Brady, chairman of the backbench committee that organises leadership contests, knows exactly how many have been submitted.Nadine DorriesIMAGE SOURCE,EPAImage caption,Nadine Dorries is urging Tory MPs to unite behind the prime ministerSpeaking on BBC Radio 4's The World at One, Ms Dorries said the debate over Partygate had become a ""Westminster bubble issue"" and the public was ""ready to move on"".""There is obviously, I think probably led by one or two individuals, a campaign behind the scenes to try, attempt to remove the prime minister for individual reasons to do with personal ambition or other reasons,"" she said.She added: ""The people who most want to get rid of Boris Johnson are Keir Starmer and the SNP"".""I would just ask my colleagues to reflect on that, and do we really want to do the opposition's work - and do we really believe the public will vote for a party that they think is divided?""Home Secretary Priti Patel has also backed the prime minister, telling Conservative MPs who want to remove him to ""forget it"", BBC political correspondent Helen Catt reports.Ms Patel told the Daily Mail that writing letters of no confidence was a ""sideshow"" and warned that the public ""wouldn't thank the Conservative Party for talking about itself at a time when people had anxieties, concerns [and] apprehensions"".She also warned colleagues against overshadowing the Platinum Jubilee celebrations, saying ""all the focus"" this weekend should be on the Queen and her ""long-standing dedicated service"".Chart: How could the Conservatives change their leader1px transparent lineDespite the uncertainty over the number of no-confidence letters, there has been mounting speculation Mr Johnson could face a no-confidence vote soon.On Monday, former Tory leader Lord Hague said the PM was in ""real trouble"" and predicted a vote could take place as early as next week, when MPs return from their short early summer recess.But speaking earlier, deputy PM Dominic Raab told Sky News he doubted the number of letters could be ""that high"".There is no consensus among Tory MPs about who should be their next leader, but Foreign Secretary Liz Truss, Trade Minister Penny Mordaunt, former Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt and senior backbencher Tom Tugendhat are among those being discussed as possible challengers.Chancellor Rishi Sunak was widely seen as a potential leadership rival to the PM, but his prospects are thought to have waned after he picked up his own Partygate fine and was embroiled in a controversy over his wife's finances earlier this year.2px presentational grey lineAnalysis box by Ione Wells, political correspondentThere's no obvious thread linking the MPs that have publicly called on the prime minister to go.Some of the calls have come in quick succession, others months apart.They've come from MPs elected in different years, with different ideologies. Some of them backed Boris Johnson at the last Tory leadership contest, others backed his rivals.Some Tory MPs are convinced there is a degree of co-ordination behind closed doors.One senior Tory told me he believes supporters of Jeremy Hunt are among those being particularly critical publicly.Others attribute the steady drip-drip of letters in recent days to a ripple effect. As soon as a few critical MPs came out publicly, they argue, others felt emboldened to do the same.Co-ordination or not, there is no doubt MPs do talk to each other - there are Whatsapp groups and sub-Whatsapp groups of Tory MPs.Even before Sue Gray's report came out, I was told the tea rooms of Westminster were alive with chatter about who was ""ready to move"".Some of that chatter has been more muted as MPs are out of office for recess - with some arguing the Jubilee weekend is not the time for ""internal warfare"".But that could all liven up again quite quickly when they return next week.2px presentational grey lineMeanwhile, the debate over the PM's future has been given fresh impetus after his standards adviser Lord Geidt called on him to explain how his own Partygate fine tallied with the rulebook for ministers, which says they have a duty to comply with the law.Along with his wife Carrie and Chancellor Rishi Sunak, Mr Johnson was fined for attending a birthday party for him in the Cabinet Room in June 2020.In a report on Monday, Lord Geidt wrote there was a ""legitimate question"" over whether this constituted a breach of the ministerial code.In a written reply, Mr Johnson said he had not fallen foul of the code because he had not broken Covid laws on purpose.In an interview with Mumsnet on Tuesday, the prime minister insisted he thought the gathering in the Cabinet Room counted as a work event, and he was ""very, very surprised"" and ""taken aback"" to have received a fine.Labour's deputy leader Angela Rayner accused the prime minister of ignoring Lord Geidt's advice, and finding himself innocent of breaching ministerial rules in ""his own courtroom"".Adding that Mr Johnson was ""dodging questions"", she called for him to ""make a statement"" on his ""apparent breach"" of the rules.For the SNP, MP Mhairi Black called on Scotland's six Tory MPs to ""step up and do the right thing"" and submit no-confidence letters in ""this Partygate prime minister"".";talk.politics.misc
Since the Taliban took control of Afghanistan’s capital, Kabul, on Aug. 15, 2021, there has been a frenetic evacuation of foreigners and Afghan nationals. Thousands of these Afghans assisted the United States government, which now puts them in danger.The United States provides a special immigrant visa to resettle such individuals. But applicants are facing long backlogs, and immigrant advocates have appealed to the Biden administration to increase the processing speed.Many of these advocates are religious organizations. Since the April 2021 announcement of U.S. troop withdrawals, faith-based organizations like Lutheran Immigrant and Refugee Services, World Relief, National Association of Evangelicals and the Jewish nonprofit HIAS, have implored the Biden administration to evacuate Afghans. Faith-based voluntary agencies are preparing to receive as many Afghan refugees as possible.This is part of a long history of religious involvement in refugee policy, in which most religious leaders support receiving refugees. However, as a refugee studies scholar, I have observed signs that such widespread support may be waning, particularly among white conservative Christians.Religious advocacy on behalf of refugeesThe idea of welcoming the stranger is central to Christianity, Judaism and Islam. It originally arose from cultures born in deserts, where leaving someone outside the city gates could be a death sentence. Religious leaders often connect that ethic to a responsibility to shield refugees and other immigrants from violence and oppression.Starting in the late 19th century, and during the Holocaust, faith communities appealed to the U.S. government to welcome Jews seeking safety from persecution. They also advocated for allowing Armenians, who were murdered en masse by leaders of the Ottoman Empire, to immigrate to America.After World War II, an alliance between Protestant, Catholic and Jewish organizations finally swayed policymakers to adopt a more humanitarian-focused U.S. foreign policy. The U.S. then joined with other nations to sign the 1951 Geneva Convention, a U.N. agreement that established the rights of refugees to legal protection.Among the convention’s main tenets is a global ban on sending refugees back to countries where they will be unsafe. This sometimes requires resettling refugees in a safer country. Faith-based organizations have been partnering with the U.S. government ever since.A person holds a sign that says Leviticus 19:34: Many advocates for refugees say their work is rooted in faith. Victoria Pickering/Flickr, CC BY-NC-NDThe sanctuary movementBetween 1951 and 1980, the government resettled refugees in the U.S. on an ad hoc basis without spending much on assisting them. During this time, faith-based organizations filled in gaps to ensure refugees got off to a good start.Religious groups also advocated for asylum seekers, people who arrived seeking protection without first getting refugee status. Between 1980 and 1991, almost 1 million Central Americans crossed the U.S. border seeking asylum. From the start, the government denied most of their petitions.Many Christian and Jewish leaders advocated on behalf of these migrants. They preached sermons, lobbied the government and organized protests calling for protecting Central American asylum seekers. Hundreds of religious communities provided sanctuary, usually inside houses of worship, and gave them legal support.In 1985 the Center for Constitutional Rights sued the federal government on behalf of the American Baptist Church, Presbyterian Church USA, the Unitarian Universalist Association, the United Methodist Church and four other religious organizations, claiming discrimination against Salvadoran and Guatemalan asylum seekers. The government later settled the class-action lawsuit, allowing temporary protection for those asylum seekers.Faith-based nonprofits supporting refugees todayEver since Congress passed the 1980 Refugee Act, creating the current system of refugee resettlement, U.S. faith-based organizations have played a central role in it.There are nine national voluntary agencies that work directly with the government, six of which are faith based: One is Jewish, one Catholic, one evangelical Christian and three are mainline Protestant. These groups arrange for refugees to find housing, land jobs and enroll in English classes. They do so regardless of the newcomers’ own religions or their countries of origin.In my research, I have found that staff at faith-based organizations commonly use religious rhetoric to justify their work and to describe their commitment.At the same time, religiously based refugee organizations frame their efforts using interfaith language. They invoke the ethical imperative to provide asylum and refuge in ways that cross-cut multiple religious traditions as they collect and disburse money and household goods – and mobilize volunteers.“The Jewish dimension is helping people realize that America is a place that welcomes all, and helping people that have come from a land where maybe sometimes being a Jew was considered worse than dirt,” a director of a local office of HIAS, formerly known as the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, told me. “Do we apply those same kinds of principles to other communities that we help? Absolutely.”The director of a Catholic Charities office echoed that sentiment. “We have a saying,” he told me. “We help people not because they are Catholic, but because we are.”Changing religious politics?Despite the deep foundation of religious belief and morality for granting asylum, this connection may have frayed, at least for some communities. In response to a record number of people displaced globally, especially people who are not white, I’m seeing signs that the moral framework supporting asylum is giving way in some quarters to support for restrictive policies that avoid any moral or international obligation to asylum seekers.This became clear when the Trump administration enacted its “zero tolerance” policy to arrest anyone crossing the border without documentation – including people with babies and toddlers. Government agents and contractors separated nearly 4,000 children from their parents, sparking outrage.Many faith leaders spoke out against the child separation, like prominent evangelical leader Franklin Graham, without directly criticizing aggressive border enforcement. But many were more pointed in their comments, specifically calling out immigrant exclusion as antithetical to their religious beliefs. Mainline Protestant, Jewish, Mormon, Catholic and evangelical Christian groups all released statements against tighter immigration enforcement itself.What was unusual is that some conservative Christian groups lobbied in favor of strengthened immigration enforcement. This was a break from the past. While there have been theological differences between conservative and mainline Protestant Christians on a number of issues, welcoming the stranger had been one point upon which Christians generally agreed.[You’re smart and curious about the world. So are The Conversation’s authors and editors. You can read us daily by subscribing to our newsletter.]Race and racial politics are intertwined with this split. There now appears to be an inverse relationship in the U.S. between religious identity and support for asylum among white Americans. In a Pew survey conducted in May 2018, only 43% of white Protestants and 25% of white evangelical Christians thought that the U.S. had a responsibility to accept refugees. Conversely, 63% of Black Protestants and 65% of the religiously unaffiliated thought that the nation has that responsibility.It is unclear whether this represents an overall downward trend in white Christian support for people seeking safe haven. Faith leaders and those working in faith-based resettlement organizations that I have spoken with recently enthusiastically support accepting as many Afghan refugees as possible.
